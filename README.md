Rough Layout:

- A large image displayed in the first column of the webpage, overlayed with the fake service name and SVG Logo, image credited and linked via Unsplash

- The remaining space will consist of:
    -Bolded Message to entice the user to enroll in the service via the sign up form

    -The Form containing the following fields:

    --First Name
    --Last Name
    --Email
    --Phone-Number
    --Password
    --Confirm Password

    -Create Account (submit button)

    - "Already have an account? Log in" button.
